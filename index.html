        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, search, output, progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br><br>
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
        What is CSS?
CSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.

Getting started with CSS
In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical details of the language along the way. We will also review the CSS syntax features you've not looked at yet.

      <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g., functional programming) styles.

JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).</p>

      <p>React is a free, open-source JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage application state, and efficiently update the user interface in response to data changes.
Key aspects of React include:
Component-Based Architecture:
React applications are built using components, which are self-contained units of code that manage their own state and rendering logic. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
Virtual DOM:
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual representation of it and only updates the actual DOM when necessary, minimizing costly DOM operations.
JSX:
React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code to be written within JavaScript. This makes it easier to create and manage UI components.</p>
